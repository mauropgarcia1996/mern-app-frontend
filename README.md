# MERN TODO App
Welcome to my full-stack TODO app! This project was built using the following technologies:

## Technologies
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database that was used to store the data for the TODO app
- Express: A web framework for Node.js that was used to build the backend API for the TODO app
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was used to build the frontend of the TODO app
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that was used to run the backend of the TODO app


In addition to these technologies, the project also makes use of the following:

- Next.js: A framework for building server-rendered React applications. It was used to build the frontend of the TODO app and handle server-side rendering.
- Nest.js: A framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. It was used to build the backend API for the TODO app and provide a modular architecture.
- Fly.io: A platform for building, deploying, and scaling serverless applications. It was used to host the TODO app and handle the continuous deployment process.

## Learning Outcomes
All of these technologies contribute to my learning in different ways. Working with MongoDB allowed me to learn about NoSQL databases and how to interact with them using the MongoDB driver. Building the backend API with Express and Nest.js taught me about building RESTful APIs and how to structure the backend of a web application. Using React and Next.js helped me learn about building modern frontends and the concepts of server-side rendering. Finally, working with Fly.io gave me experience with serverless architectures and continuous deployment.

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience and has helped me improve my skills in full-stack web development. I hope you find this project useful as well!


## Getting Started
To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository (frontend & backend)
git clone https://github.com/mauropgarcia1996/mern-app-frontend
git clone https://github.com/mauropgarcia1996/mern-app

# Install the dependencies (frontend & backend)
cd mern-app-frontend
npm install
cd ../mern-app
npm install
```

You can then run the frontend and backend of the TODO app using the following commands:

```bash
# Run the frontend
cd mern-app-frontend
npm run dev

# Run the backend
cd mern-app
npm run start:dev
```

You can now access the frontend of the TODO app at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:8080.
